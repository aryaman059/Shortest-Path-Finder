This is a Python-based GUI application that helps visualize and compute the shortest path between nodes in a user-defined graph using Dijkstra’s Algorithm. Built with Tkinter for the GUI and NetworkX + Matplotlib for graph creation and visualization, this project is ideal for understanding graph traversal and shortest path algorithms.

Features-
Add nodes and weighted edges interactively

Visualize the graph in real time

Select source and destination nodes

Compute and display the shortest path using Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Reset the graph or save the current structure

Tech Stack-
Python

Tkinter – GUI Framework

NetworkX – Graph data structure and algorithms

Matplotlib – Graph visualization
